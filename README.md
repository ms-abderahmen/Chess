# Chess

This is a chess game I started making when we had the Object-Oriented Programming class at school. So, to make the learning process more fun, and since I already had some knowledge of OOP before the course, I decided to make a game where I use OOP the most.
And this is when I got the idea of making this simple game, and I had so much fun making it. I'm thinking of going back to it to implement either an AI that you can play against, or an online feature.
